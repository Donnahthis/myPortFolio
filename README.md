The project majors on basics of HTML and CSS. The content here encourages the first beginners to practice their small knowledge
of coding. This project is arranged in a way that the user will be able to interact with different kinds of
programming languages. Therefore the user is able to learn knew things about programming. Stay put as you go through your
learning experience.

## <strong>Setup/Installation Requirements</strong>
* The best way to learn the content of the project is by systematic follow up of the project. <strong>DO MORE RESEARCH</strong>, share
your experience with the technical mentors. In case you find difficulties in understanding a concept, do research from the internet.
Please maximise this opportunity and leave nothing undone.
